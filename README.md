## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript

### Continued development

- Redo the project to use a Javascript Framework, React, for implementing performance optimization, performance and cross-platform compatibility and reusability

- to improve the site to be a Fullstack application. Users should be able to edit and delete the todos to be served in a database. Currently all the read and write operations are lost upon refreshing as the changes are not being served to a database.
